## Why iamtired?

Most tools force you to choose between a whiteboard and a document editor. **iamtired** fuses them into a single, seamless engine for thought.

### 🚀 Think Without Borders
Break free from linear documents. Organize your ideas the way your brain actually works—spatially.
*   **Infinite Canvas:** Pan, zoom, and sprawl your ideas across a boundless workspace.
*   **Visual Logic:** Connect concepts with labeled edges to map relationships, arguments, and workflows.
*   **Adaptive Interface:** A glassmorphism UI that looks stunning in Light and Dark modes, with a grid that scales as you zoom.

### ✍️ Write With Power
Don't sacrifice depth for space. Every node is a fully-featured word processor.
*   **WYSIWYG Markdown:** Write beautiful content with headers, lists, and code blocks directly on the canvas.
*   **Distraction-Free Focus:** Double-click any node to enter a dedicated writing mode, fading out the noise.
*   **Rich Media:** Drag-and-drop images or embed URLs instantly.

### 🧠 A Second Brain That Actually Thinks
Integrated deeply into the workflow, the AI acts as a true intellectual partner, not just a chatbot sidebar.

*   **Contextual Branching:** Don't just brainstorm; **mind-meld**. Click "Branch" on any node, and the AI analyzes the parent context to generate relevant, connected sub-topics automatically. It builds your knowledge graph *for you*.
*   **One-Click Expansion:** Have a rough idea? Turn a single bullet point into a comprehensive, well-structured article with the "Expand" feature.
*   **Semantic Editing:** Highlight any text and instruct the AI naturally. "Make this more professional," "Summarize this in three bullets," or "Fix the tone."
*   **Visual Intelligence:** Instantly generate bespoke cover art for your nodes using DALL-E 3 or Gemini, or have the AI scour the web to find the perfect reference image.
*   **Multi-Model Freedom:** We believe in choice. Bring your own keys for **Google Gemini, OpenAI, Claude, OpenRouter**, or run completely offline with **Local LLMs (Ollama)**.

### 🔒 Privacy by Design
Your thoughts belong to you.
*   **Local-First Architecture:** All data is saved instantly to your browser's local storage.
*   **No Vendor Lock-in:** Export your entire brain graph to JSON at any time.
*   **Zero-Database:** We don't store your data. Your API keys live on your device, nowhere else.
