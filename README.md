# NoteVerse Canvas 🌌

### The Ultimate Knowledge Workspace.

**NoteVerse Canvas** is what happens when **Obsidian**, **Notion**, and **Excalidraw** have a child, raised by **Google Docs**.

It is an infinite spatial knowledge engine that fuses the freedom of a whiteboard with the power of a structured document editor. Connect ideas visually, write deeply, and expand your mind with integrated **Gemini AI**.

## ✨ The Ultimate Hybrid: Feature Highlights

**NoteVerse Canvas** isn't just another app; it's the genetic super-hybrid of your favorite tools.

### 🎨 **Spatial Freedom (The Excalidraw/OneNote DNA)**
Break out of the linear document mindset.
*   **Infinite Canvas:** Pan, zoom, and sprawl your ideas across a boundless 2D plane.
*   **Visual Organization:** Cluster related notes, create mind maps, and organize spatially. If you can visualize it, you can structure it here.

### 🧠 **Networked Thought (The Obsidian/Roam DNA)**
Your ideas don't exist in a vacuum.
*   **Visual Knowledge Graph:** Connect any node to any other node with tangible, labeled relationship lines.
*   **Contextual Branching:** See exactly how your arguments flow and evolve. It’s a mind map that actually contains your full content.

### 📝 **Deep Writing (The Notion/Docs DNA)**
Don't sacrifice writing power for visual layout.
*   **Full WYSIWYG Editor:** Every node is a fully capable document editor.
*   **Markdown Native:** Use familiar shortcuts (`##`, `**`, `-`) to format text instantly while typing.
*   **Distraction-Free Focus:** Double-click a node to zoom in and focus purely on writing, blocking out the rest of the universe.

### 🤖 **AI-Native Intelligence (Powered by Gemini)**
The "Second Brain" that actually thinks.
*   **Thought Expansion:** Writer's block is obsolete. Type a title, click "Expand," and watch a full article materialize.
*   **Context-Aware Generation:** Branching off a node? The AI reads the parent node to ensure the new content flows logically from the source.
*   **Semantic Refinement:** Ask the AI to "make it punchier," "fix grammar," or "summarize" directly within the editor.

### 🖼️ **Rich Media & Visuals**
*   **AI Image Generation:** Need a specific visual for your concept? Generate it instantly with **Gemini 2.5 Flash Image**.
*   **Grounded Search:** Pull real-world reference images directly from Google Search to ground your notes in reality.
