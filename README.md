What This Now Communicates (Implicitly but Fairly)

* Google Docs = best-in-class collaborative linear writing
* Notion = structured documents + databases
* Obsidian = extensible personal knowledge systems
* OneNote = flexible freeform notes
* Excalidraw / Miro = spatial & collaborative canvases
* iamtired = writing + spatial thinking + AI in one surface, without plugins
---

## Why **iamtired**?

Most tools force a false choice: a **whiteboard** for thinking or a **document editor** for writing.
**iamtired** removes that boundary—combining spatial thinking, serious writing, and AI into one continuous workspace.

---

### 🚀 Think Without Borders

Your ideas don’t live in pages. They live in space.

* **Infinite Canvas:** Pan, zoom, and expand endlessly—no limits, no pages.
* **Free Linking & Mind Mapping:** Connect nodes freely to build arguments, systems, and idea graphs with real spatial awareness.
* **Visual Logic:** Labeled edges clarify relationships, causality, and workflows.
* **Group Nodes:** Group related ideas without locking them into rigid hierarchies.
* **Nested Groups:** Group nodes *inside* other groups for deep structure.
* **Intelligent Groups:** Group nodes behave as first-class objects, not static containers.
* **Unlimited Tabs:** Work across multiple canvases simultaneously.
* **Tab Search & Drag-and-Drop:** Instantly search, reorder, and manage tabs.

---

### ✍️ Write With Power

Every node is a real document—styled, expressive, and precise.

* **Full Markdown Support:** Headers, lists, code blocks, tables, and more.
* **WYSIWYG Markdown Rendering:** Write Markdown, see a clean, modern preview instantly.
* **Custom Table & Layout Styling:** Tables and blocks use readable, modern design elements.
* **Distraction-Free Writing Mode:** Double-click a node to isolate it and fade out the rest.
* **Rich Media:** Drag-and-drop images or embed URLs directly into nodes.

---

### 🧠 A Second Brain That Actually Thinks

AI is embedded into how ideas grow—not bolted on.

* **Contextual Branching:** Click **Branch** and the AI generates relevant connected sub-nodes using full context.
* **One-Click Expansion:** Turn a rough note or bullet into a structured article instantly.
* **Semantic Editing:** Select text and give natural instructions like
  *“Make this more professional,” “Summarize in three bullets,” “Fix the tone.”*
* **Visual Intelligence:**

  * Generate AI images using **any configured model**.
  * Ask questions **about images**.
  * Ask AI to **explain images** or **write captions**.
* **Multi-Model Freedom:** Use **OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, OpenRouter**, or run fully offline with **local LLMs (Ollama)**.

---

### 🎨 Design That Stays Out of the Way

Powerful visuals without visual noise.

* **Modern Glassmorphism UI:** Clean, translucent design that feels light and focused.
* **Adaptive Light & Dark Modes:** Looks great in any environment.
* **Scalable Grid System:** The grid scales naturally as you zoom in or out.
* **Full Typography Control:** Customize **font family, size, weight, and color**.
* **Blur Controls:** Toggle blur on individual nodes or objects for focus or abstraction.
* **Spatial Styling:** Style nodes visually without breaking structure.
* **Intuitive Interface:** Everything is where you expect it—nothing fights you.

---

### 🖱️ Built for Flow

Fast interaction, zero friction.

* **Intelligent Context Menus:** Right-click actions adapt to what you select.
* **Bulk Editing:** Select multiple nodes and act on them together.
* **Node Operations:** Duplicate, copy, cut, and paste single or multiple nodes instantly.
* **Drag-Based Editing:** Move, group, resize, and rearrange everything naturally.

---

### 🔒 Privacy by Design

Your thoughts stay yours.

* **Local-First Architecture:** Everything is saved directly in your browser.
* **Zero Database:** We don’t store your data—period.
* **Bring Your Own Keys:** API keys live only on your device.
* **No Vendor Lock-In:** Export and import your entire brain graph to JSON anytime.

---
